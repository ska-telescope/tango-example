# ska-tango-examples

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/ska-tango-examples/badge/?version=latest)](https://developer.skatelescope.org/projects/ska-tango-examples/en/latest/?badge=latest)

This project demonstrates how to structure an SKA project that provides some simple Tango devices coded in PyTango. 

## Installation

This project is structured to use k8s for development and testing so that the build environment, test environment and test results are all completely reproducible and are independent of host environment. It uses ``make`` to provide a consistent UI (run ``make help`` for targets documentation).

### Add submodules

This project uses git submodules. In order to clone them use:
```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Install docker

Follow the instructions available at [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/).

### Install minikube

You will need to install `minikube` or equivalent k8s installation in order to set up your test environment. You can follow the instruction at [here](https://gitlab.com/ska-telescope/sdi/deploy-minikube/):
```
git clone git@gitlab.com:ska-telescope/sdi/deploy-minikube.git
cd deploy-minikube
make all
eval $(minikube docker-env)
```

*Please note that the command `eval $(minikube docker-env)` will point your local docker client at the docker-in-docker for minikube. Use this only for building the docker image and another shell for other work. This also means that when changing the shell (i.e. calling `poetry shell`) you should rerun this command from inside the `deploy-minikube` repo in order to add the relevant variables to the path.*

## How to Use

Clone this repo: 
```
git clone https://gitlab.com/ska-telescope/ska-tango-examples.git
cd ska-tango-examples
```

Build a new Docker image for the project:
```
$ make oci-build
[...]
[+] Building 111.7s (14/14) FINISHED 
[...]
```

Install python requirements:
```
poetry install
```

Run python-test:
```
$ poetry shell
$ make python-test

## TANGO-controls examples

### Basic Example

The basic example is meant to demonstrate the change event with polling on attribute. 
It contains 3 devices called 'powersupply' (taken from  [here](https://pytango.readthedocs.io/en/stable/server_api/server.html)), "motor' and 'eventreceiver. It is contained into the package ``src/ska_tango_example/basic_example``.

The motor uses the powersupply and generate a (random) performance value attribute which is polled (with automatic fire of the related change event). The eventreceiver receives that event. 

### Counter

The counter is an example of firing events with both a polled and a non polled attribute. 

### Teams

This package contains devices created and used by various SKA teams for testing other applications and for demonstrating concepts. 

### Tabata

The tabata is a realization of a gym workout (more information at [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-intensity_interval_training)).

An example of this application can be found [here](https://www.tabatatimer.com/).

The TANGO-controls concepts demonstrated are:
- use of device properties;
- handling of events coming from 5 other devices;
- managing a simple state attribute (DevState and RunningState);
- threading with TANGO. 

The tabata device has 2 commands: Start and Stop. The start trigger the decrement on the counters to perform its job. 

### AsyncTabata

Same as Tabata but the realization is asynchonous. 

The tabata device has 2 commands: Run and Stop. The run executes the entire job so it's not possible to use it without an async command.
The async device does not use the tango monitor, so lock is managed directly by the device. 

### ForAttrTabata

This is a simple device, with only forwarded attributes coming form the counters forming the tabata. It has no commands and no mocking test since forwarded attributes can be tested only with a real deployment.

### Long running

See the README.md under `src/ska_tango_examples/teams/long_running/`

### jupyTango

We have included jupyTango here as well because it almost seamlessly combines Jupyter Noteboks with Tango Controls. Or in other words jupyTango is the common developer's Swiss Army Knife for Tango Controls exploration. You can find the installation instructions [here](jupyTango/README.md).

## Expose Tango Devices in the external network

Since v0.4.19, Tango Examples allows developers to convert Tango Kubernetes services to Loadbalancer type.

By default, this behavior is enabled if you want to deploy on Minikube by keeping the flag ``$MINIKUBE`` active. 
If you want to deploy on a remote Kubernetes cluster, you must disable ``$MINIKUBE`` and enable ``$EXPOSE_All_DS``. 
The best approach is to change these flags on your local ``PrivateRules.mak``.

### Metallb
For Minikube or Openstack clusters, we depend on Metallb to expose ``Loadbalancer`` services. 
Metallb is deployed and configured automatically if you use the 
[Deploy Minikube](https://gitlab.com/ska-telescope/sdi/ska-cicd-deploy-minikube) repository.

```
$ minikube addons list
|-----------------------------|----------|--------------|--------------------------------|
|         ADDON NAME          | PROFILE  |    STATUS    |           MAINTAINER           |
|-----------------------------|----------|--------------|--------------------------------|
...
| metallb                     | minikube | enabled âœ…   | third-party (metallb)          |
...
|-----------------------------|----------|--------------|--------------------------------|
```

After the umbrella chart deployment, we can see the services as type ``Loadbalancer`` and the allocated external IP address.

![Tango Devices Services as LoadBalancers](<img/loadbalancer_k8s.png> "Tango Devices Services")

### DNS

Loadbalancer Kubernetes services on [Minikube](https://gitlab.com/ska-telescope/sdi/ska-cicd-deploy-minikube)
and STFC (project TechOps) have an automatic DNS resolution using an external CoreDNS deployment.
It uses the same url structure of the internal Kubernetes network ``<loadBalancer-svc>.<namespace>.svc.<cluster-domain>``.
Note: `<cluster-domain>` for STFC Techops is `techops.internal.skao.int` but set it to the your own cluster's value.
For the minikube, or by default, it is `cluster.local`


You have to update the DNS configuration of your local development environment to redirect to Core DNS. 
On Minikube, must run ``make minikube-extdns-ip`` on 
[Deploy Minikube Repository](https://gitlab.com/ska-telescope/sdi/ska-cicd-deploy-minikube/-/tree/master). 
For the STFC cluster, you must point to Terminus (192.168.99.194).

#### Ubuntu
The STFC VPN automatically changes the DNS redirection on your host.
In case of any malfunction with STFC VPN DNS or working with Minikube, 
we need to update the systemd-resolved config ``/etc/systemd/resolved.conf``.
```
[Resolve]
DNS=<dns-ip-address>
Domains=~svc.<cluster-domain>
```

#### WSL

For newer versions of WSL2, systemd is available, by editing ``/etc/wsl.conf`` as follows:
```
...
[boot]
systemd=true
...
```
Followed by ``wsl --shutdown `` and then, ``wsl`` to restart it again, in Powershell.

If your WSL does not have systemd, any changes on systemd-resolved are not applied. 
One workaround is to delete the file ``/etc/resolv.conf`` and create a new one.
The external CoreDNS IP goes on the first line, and any public DNS of your choice in the following line(s).
```
nameserver <extdns ip>
nameserver 8.8.8.8 # Google DNS
nameserver 1.1.1.1 # Cloudfare DNS
```
These DNS configuration files are recreated on every startup (point to Windows host DNS), 
so we need to add a variable on the WSL settings ``/etc/wsl.conf`` to disable that.
```
...
[network]
generateResolvConf = false
...
```
Finally, shutdown WSL on PowerShell ``wsl --shutdown `` and then, ``wsl`` to restart it again.

## ska-tango-images

Please note that this project make use of the charts and docker images for the TANGO-controls framework available at [here](https://gitlab.com/ska-telescope/ska-tango-images).

## Test execution

All tests created for the present project can run in simulated mode or in a real environment except for the ones marked as ``post_deployment``. 

``make k8s-test`` runs all the application test procedures defined in the folder ``tests`` in a new pod in the k8s deployment. This target copies the tests folder into a new pod and execute the test with the option ``--true-context`` allowing the execution to happen against the real application. On success it copies the resulting output and test artefacts out of the container and into the folder ``charts/build`` directory, ready for inclusion in the CI server's downloadable artefacts.

``make python-test`` runs the application test procedures (except the ones marked as ``post_deployment``) defined in the folder `tests` without starting a new pod. The result will be found in the ``build``. 

## Debugging with vscode

In order to debug a device server, this project uses the library  [debugpy](https://github.com/microsoft/debugpy/). To be able to debug your code, just run the following command: 

```
$ kubectl port-forward pod/tabata-tabata-0 12345:5678 -n ska-tango-examples
```

The above command will create a port forwarding between the local machine and the event receiver pod. 

Once done open the Run tab on vscode and press the debug button which correspond to the launch.json configuration file ``Python: Remote Attach``. 

The ``.vscode`` folder contains also the settings to be able to run the pytest with the python extension. Note that it expects that a ``venv`` folder is present.

## Makefile targets

This project contains a Makefile which acts as a UI for building Docker images, testing images, and for launching interactive developer environments.
For the documentation of the Makefile run ``make help``.

## MacOS users

The Python binding for TANGO-controls framework does not work out of the box in MacOS. However MacOS users can still use this repository for development.
The TANGO-controls framework is needed only for unit-testing (``make python-test``) to provide debugging capability and, together with the unit-testing target it is also provided another target in the Makefile to make the same run inside a container (in this case no debug capability are available). 

Run python-test with:
```
$ make pipeline_unit_test

## Windows Users

The preffered way for using this repository on windows is with the help of [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) and Ubuntu 22.04. 


## Running GUIs

Note: your Xserver needs to allow TCP connections. This will be different for each window manager, but on Ubuntu 20.04 using gdm3 it can be enabled by editing /etc/gdm3/custom.conf and adding:
```
[security]
DisallowTCP=false
```

In order for these changes to take effect you will need to restart X (it's just easier to reboot).
