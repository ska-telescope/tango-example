    This class is a convenience class for long running command devices.

    The intent of this class is that clients should not have to keep
    track of command IDs or the various attributes
    to determine long running command progress/results.

    This class is also useful when you want to run a long running
    command across various devices. Once they all complete a callback
    supplied by the user is fired.

    Using this class, a client would need to:
    - Supply the Tango devices to connect to that implements long
    running commands
    - The Long running commands to run (including parameter)
    - Optional callback that should be executed when the command
    completes

    The callback will be executed once the command completes across all
    devices. Thus there's no need to watch attribute changes or keep
    track of commands IDs. They are handled here.
