# Test case (3,4):
# - Run a device server that depends on another device server that takes a long
#   time to start. While it has not started, is the same as being offline, in this
#   case, for two minutes
#
# Expected behavior:
# - The device server resources should be in a "pending" state and information
#   about why is it pending deployment available
#
# Behavior with ska-tango-util:
# - The device server is deployed and is hold-up by the init-container, that after
#   a few retries, crashes. This crashes will make the init-container go into
#   'CrashLoopBackoff' further increasing the time it takes to boot the device
#
# Behavior with the ska-tango-operator:
# - Missing operator tests to analyze current behavior
#
